robotCrawl
==========

Crawler robot attack! Just kidding! It's an experiment with new programming languages and webpages.
This repository was created because of a challenge where i should create a crawler that could've get info from webpages.
That got out of control and i just want to improve and improve. And it's fun! It's fun when you get to understand the concepts of some types of softwares that are out there in the woods (internet).

Feel free to give your opinion on my code.
